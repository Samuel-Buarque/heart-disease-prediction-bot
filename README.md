<h1>heart-disease-prediction-bot</h1>
This project is a bot designed to predict whether a person has heart disease based on a real exam database retrieved from Kaggle. The bot uses both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, specifically an MLP architecture and K-means clustering

The Heart Disease Prediction Bot leverages machine learning algorithms to classify whether a person has heart disease. The dataset used for training and testing the model is obtained from Kaggle, ensuring the use of real and relevant data.
